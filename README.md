A small collection of Image Based Denoising algorithms written in Python. Small writeup and demo images can be seen here: [link to demo.](https://maturk.github.io/page/2023/02/03/image_denoising.html) All algorithms are hard coded. Requirements are only numpy and Pillow (see requirements.txt).

### Gaussian Blur
Gaussian blur is one of the simplest denoising algorithms and it amounts to estimating
at each pixel position a local average of intensities and corresponds to low-pass filtering.

```
python ./gaussian-blur/gaussian-blur.py --size 5 --sigma 1 --show True --save True
```
### Bilateral Filter
The bilateral filter is technique to smooth images while preserving edges. It consists of a weighted product of two gaussian kernels, one for pixel distances (sigma_space) and another for pixel intensities (sigma_color). 

```
python ./bilateral-filter/bilateral-filter.py --size 10 --sigma_color 10  --sigma_space 10 --show True --save True
```
