A small collection of Image Based Denoising algorithms

## Algorithms:
- [ ] Bilateral filter

## Gaussian Blur
Gaussian blur is one of the simplest denoising algorithms and it amounts to estimating
at each pixel position a local average of intensities and corresponds to low-pass filtering.

## Bilateral Filter
The bilateral filter is technique to smooth images while preserving edges. Its formulation is simple: each pixel is replaced by an average of its neighbors.
