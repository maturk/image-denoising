A small collection of Image Based Denoising algorithms written in Python

## Algorithms:
- [x] Gaussian blur
- [ ] Bilateral filter

### Gaussian Blur
Gaussian blur is one of the simplest denoising algorithms and it amounts to estimating
at each pixel position a local average of intensities and corresponds to low-pass filtering.

### Bilateral Filter
The bilateral filter is technique to smooth images while preserving edges.
